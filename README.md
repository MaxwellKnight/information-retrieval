# Information Retrieval Course Project

This repository contains projects and exercises from an academic course on **Information Retrieval**. 
The work is implemented in Python and leverages powerful libraries such as 
**pandas**, **NumPy**, **NLTK**, **TextBlob**, **spaCy**, and more.
These tools support tasks like text processing, sentiment analysis, and natural language understanding.

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Using TextBlob and custom sentiment models
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Utilizing spaCy and NLTK for language modeling
- **Statistical Analysis**: Data manipulation and analysis with pandas and NumPy
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize key insights from text data

This repository is an excellent resource for anyone interested in exploring information retrieval and applying NLP techniques in Python.
